        <p>Co-developed <strong>PIS</strong> with Weijie Yang (UCB). We proposed a unified perspective for PDE-constrained parameter estimation: an end-to-end solver based on diffusion models. <a href="https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.23577.68963">View work</a>.</p>

        <p>I developed <strong>Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN)</strong>, an end-to-end framework for characterizing hydraulic conductivities. Open source <a href="https://github.com/XunZhangMarcus/Diffusion-Inversion-Net">code</a>. <br>

          This work realizes an idea I had 2 years ago! Huge thanks to Weijie Yang and my supervisors. <br>
          <em>Reflection:</em> I initially hoped to prove a theoretical equivalence between Diffusion models and Kalman Filters (Data Assimilation). While they share a Bayesian correction intuition, the direct mathematical link remains elusive. A small "disappointment," but I hope future theorists will bridge this gap!

        <p>I participated in the Tongji University Summer School program "Climate Change and Global Governance - Exploring Norway and the Arctic," where I visited Svalbard island, Arctic! And I made many valuable friends and learned a lot of new knowledge about hydrology and the environment. Super joyful experience! Grateful for everyone I've met.😊</p>
