  <p>Since the fourth grade of elementary school, I have been immersed in the world of gaming. During my childhood, I became proficient in a wide range of games, including the entire series of the arcade game "KOF," the full collection of "Knights of Valour," and "CF." When I entered junior high school, I began to explore "League of Legends" (LOL). Over the past years, my number of LOL matches has reached 7,061, with a cumulative playtime of 6,000 hours.</p>

<div class="philosophy-section">
  <h3>🧠 Lessons Learned</h3>
  
  <p>Gaming has taught me many profound philosophies that extend far beyond the virtual world:</p>
  
  <div class="quote-highlight">
    "Climbing the ranks in games mirrors the struggle of rowing upstream in life."
  </div>
  
  <ul style="margin-top: 1em;">
    <li><strong>Perseverance:</strong> The importance of persistence in the face of challenges</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic Thinking:</strong> Planning ahead and adapting to changing circumstances</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Reflection:</strong> Learning from failures and continuous improvement</li>
    <li><strong>Inner Strength:</strong> Finding calm and focus during turbulent times</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p style="margin-top: 1em;">Without the experience of gaming, during those turbulent and fluctuating years of growth, I might not have had the space and time to build my inner self. Those countless days and nights, though I was alone, my heart was calm.</p>

  <p>Here, I pen my farewell to gaming. I will never forget those countless days and nights. Though I was alone, my heart was calm. Gaming has taught me many profound philosophies. Without the experience of gaming, during those turbulent and fluctuating years of growth, I might not have had the space and time to build my inner self.</p>
</div>

<div class="farewell-message">
  <h3>🌅 A New Chapter Begins</h3>
  
  <p>But times have changed. It's time to make a change. I should let it go.</p>
  
  <div style="margin: 1.5em 0; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: italic;">
    "Farewell to gaming and the chapter of my life it defined."
  </div>
  
  <p>As I transition from virtual achievements to real-world impact through research and academic pursuits, I carry forward the valuable lessons learned: strategic thinking, perseverance, and the ability to find calm in complexity. These skills now serve me in groundwater modeling, data analysis, and scientific research.</p>
  
  <p style="margin-top: 1em;"><strong>This isn't an ending—it's a transformation.</strong></p>

## 🔄 From Gaming to Research

The transition from gaming to academic research represents more than just a change in activities—it's an evolution of purpose:

- **Strategic Thinking** → Research methodology and experimental design
- **Problem Solving** → Tackling complex environmental challenges  
- **Persistence** → Pursuing long-term research goals
- **Continuous Learning** → Staying current with scientific advances
- **Team Coordination** → Collaborative research and academic partnerships

*This farewell marks not just the end of a gaming chapter, but the beginning of applying those hard-earned skills toward making a meaningful impact in the world of science and environmental protection.*
