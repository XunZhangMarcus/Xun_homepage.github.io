<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

- Hello there! I'm Xun, currently a M.S. candidate (3th year) in Hydraulic Engineering at Tongji University. I plan to defend my dissertation in June 2024. 

- My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Water Conservancy and Hydraulic Engineering from Northwest A&F University, where I studied everything related to hydraulic engineering complex and its interaction with the environment.

- Currently, I am trying to discover a more creative fusion between Data Science and Hydrogeology. My research specifically focuses on reactive transport modeling, which is crucial for evaluating groundwater quality and contamination risks, thereby ensuring the safety of drinking water. Briefly speaking, my work primarily concentrates on two areas: developing new deep learning-based parameterization methods (DLPMs) and creating deep learning surrogate models to predict groundwater solute transport.

- I plan to pursue a PhD degree in the near future.

- Feel free to connect with me to discuss research, collaboration, or any exciting opportunities!

**Fun facts about me**: 
- If you don't see Xun in the office, he is probably playing guitar, listening to music, reading books, or playing basketball.
- Xun was once the guitarist for the band named Vodka-Filled Ashtray.
