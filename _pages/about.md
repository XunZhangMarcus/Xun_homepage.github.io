# About me
- Hello there! I'm Xun, currently a M.S. candidate (third year) in Hydraulic Engineering at Tongji University. I plan to defend my dissertation in June 2025. 

- My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Water Conservancy and Hydraulic Engineering from Northwest A&F University, where I studied everything related to hydraulic engineering complex and its interaction with the environment.

- Currently, I am trying to discover a more creative fusion between Data Science and Hydrogeology. My research specifically focuses on **groundwater flow and solute transport modeling**, which is crucial for evaluating groundwater quality and contamination risks, thereby ensuring the safety of drinking water. Briefly, my work primarily concentrates on two areas: developing new deep learning-based parameterization methods (DLPMs) and creating deep learning surrogate models to predict groundwater solute transport.

- I plan to pursue a PhD degree in the near future.

- Feel free to reach out for discussion, collaboration, or any exciting opportunities!

# ü§´ Fun facts about Xun
- If you don't see Xun working in the office, he is probably playing guitar, listening to music, reading books, or playing basketball.
- Xun was once the guitarist for the band named Vodka-Filled Ashtray.
- Xun once served as the bass section leader of the GLEAM chorus, where he spent a wonderful time.

# üéÆ Farewell to Gaming
- Since the fourth grade of elementary school, I have been immersed in the world of gaming. During my childhood, I became proficient in a wide range of games, including the entire series of the arcade game "KOF," the full collection of "Knights of Valour," and "CF." When I entered junior high school, I began to explore "League of Legends" (LOL). Over the past year alone, my number of LOL matches has reached 7,061, with a cumulative playtime of 6,000 hours.

- Here, I pen my farewell to gaming. I will never forget those countless days and nights. Though I was alone, my heart was calm. Gaming has taught me many profound philosophies. Climbing the ranks in games mirrors the struggle of rowing upstream in life. Without the experience of gaming, during those turbulent and fluctuating years of growth, I might not have had the space and time to build my inner self.

- But times have changed. It's time to make a change. I should let it go. Farewell to gaming and the chapter of my life it defined.
