# About me
- Hello there! I'm Xun, currently a Research Assistant in Hydraulic Engineering at Tongji University. 

- My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Water Conservancy and Hydraulic Engineering from Northwest A&F University, where I studied everything related to hydraulic engineering complex and its interaction with the environment.

- Currently, I am trying to discover a more creative fusion between Data Science and Hydrogeology. My research specifically focuses on **groundwater flow and solute transport modeling**, which is crucial for evaluating groundwater quality and contamination risks, thereby ensuring the safety of drinking water. Briefly, my work primarily concentrates on two areas: developing new deep learning-based parameterization methods (DLPMs) and creating deep learning surrogate models to predict groundwater solute transport.

- I plan to pursue a PhD degree in the near future.

- Feel free to reach out for discussion, collaboration, or any exciting opportunities!
