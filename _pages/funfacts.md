# ðŸŽ® Farewell to Gaming
- Since the fourth grade of elementary school, I have been immersed in the world of gaming. During my childhood, I became proficient in a wide range of games, including the entire series of the arcade game "KOF," the full collection of "Knights of Valour," and "CF." When I entered junior high school, I began to explore "League of Legends" (LOL). Over the past years, my number of LOL matches has reached 7,061, with a cumulative playtime of 6,000 hours.

- Here, I pen my farewell to gaming. I will never forget those countless days and nights. Though I was alone, my heart was calm. Gaming has taught me many profound philosophies. Climbing the ranks in games mirrors the struggle of rowing upstream in life. Without the experience of gaming, during those turbulent and fluctuating years of growth, I might not have had the space and time to build my inner self.

- But times have changed. It's time to make a change. I should let it go. Farewell to gaming and the chapter of my life it defined.
