  ## 💧 Hydro90
- [Hydro90](https://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~x.zhou/hydro90/index.html) was established in June 2020 with the aim of fostering communication among young hydrologists, promoting the latest research achievements of the new generation in hydrology, and sharing the latest information in related fields (conferences, job opportunities, new technologies, etc.). 
- I joined Hydro90 as an editorial board member in September 2023.
- Hydro90 is a vibrant community! It continues to strive for greater impact in the field of hydrology and welcomes all interested participants.
